### Understanding Interface Status Output

When DraNet allocates a network interface to a Pod via a `ResourceClaim`, it publishes the status of the allocated device within the `ResourceClaim`'s `status` field. This provides crucial insights into the readiness and configuration of the network interface from a Kubernetes perspective, adhering to the standardized device status defined in [KEP-4817](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-node/4817-resource-claim-device-status/README.md).

After a `ResourceClaim` is processed and a network device is allocated, its status is reflected under `ResourceClaim.status.devices`. This section contains `conditions` and `networkData` for each allocated device.

#### Conditions

The `conditions` array provides a timeline of the device's state and indicates whether specific aspects of its configuration and readiness have been met. DraNet reports the following conditions:

* **`Ready` (type `NetworkDeviceReady`)**: Indicates that the network device has been successfully moved into the Pod's network namespace and is configured.
* **`NetworkReady`**: Signifies that the network interface within the Pod has been successfully configured with its IP addresses and routes.
* **`RDMALinkReady`**: (Applies only when RDMA is used in exclusive mode) Indicates that the associated RDMA link device has been successfully moved into the Pod's network namespace.

Each condition includes:
* **`lastTransitionTime`**: The timestamp when the condition last changed.
* **`message`**: A human-readable message about the condition.
* **`reason`**: A single-word identifier for the reason for the condition's last transition.
* **`status`**: "True", "False", or "Unknown" indicating the state of the condition.
* **`type`**: The specific type of condition (e.g., "Ready", "NetworkReady").

#### Network Data (`networkData`)

The `networkData` field provides standardized output about the network interface as it appears inside the Pod. This data is crucial for applications that need to dynamically discover their assigned network interfaces.

* **`interfaceName`**: The actual name of the network interface inside the Pod (e.g., "eth0", "eth99").
* **`hardwareAddress`**: The MAC address of the network interface.
* **`ips`**: A list of IP addresses (in CIDR format) assigned to the interface.

### Example Output

Here's an example of the `status` section from a `ResourceClaim` named `dummy-interface-static-ip-route`, showing the conditions and network data for an allocated network interface:

```yaml
